# Fattrack - weight tracker

Yes I know the name is terrible.

Anyway, this is a barebones webapp that just gives you a text box to enter a
daily weight, and store it. It can only record one value per day.

Or rather, that's the plan... for now it's the default Rails welcome page.

This is a quick personal tool I wrote to help me track my progress on my New
Year's resolution.

## Running

It's a Rails app, so any general guide to deploying Rails apps will work.  I
intend to run it behind an Apache instance, to provide basic HTTP auth
protection.
